# spotify-scraping-stuff

- spotify_chart_scraper.py contains a function that uses playwright(headless browser) to log into spotifycharts.com and scrape a authentication token which can then be used to access the charts api.

- jsScraper and jsScraperOld are javascript scrapers that do the same just with the spotify webplayer (for unfiltered streams etc..).
